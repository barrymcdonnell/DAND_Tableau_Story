# Prosper Loan Data: A Tableau Story
Creating a Tableau story as part of the Udacity DAND programme

First version of the story: [insert link here]

Final version of the story: [insert link here]

# Summary

Prosper is a peer-to-peer loan platform allowing people to borrow money from other individuals at certain rates, enabling them to bypass traditional banks and potentially making loans more affordable and accessible for thousands of people.

There are over 110,000 observations in the data set with 81 variable covering such things as the original date of the loan, the amount of the loan, the APR, a credit score, geographical state information, debt to income ratio and many more

# Design

The first story part is to look at the loan amount and the number of loans over the different years in the dataset. Data starts from 2005 through to 2014, covering a 10-year period. Here we can see the general time series trend of the data and we can tell at a glance if loan amounts and numbers have increased or decreased over the time period.

The second part of the story looks at the number of loans issued by employment status. This can give us a good overview to see how the distribution of loans is spread depending on peoples' employment status

The third part of the story takes a slightly different perspective and looks at lender yield per year. This, again, is a time series view showing the average lender yield per year. There is also a trend line on the graph to easily see if the yield is increasing  or decreasing over the years.

The fourth part of the story takes a geographical view of the data. It looks at average loan amount by state. This lets us see if any particular regions in the country are lending more than others. Also, on the dashboard is the sum of the amount of the loans by state too. This allows us to see variances in the amount lent, but not necessarily in the average amount lent.

The final part of the story shows a bubble chart looking at the amount of monet lent, based on the income range that applicants specified. This allows us to see that there are certain income brackets where the range isn't specified, but where loans were still obtained.
